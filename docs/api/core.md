# Core API

## PlayerManager

The PlayerManager should only exist once in your application and is responsible for managing the different [players](#player) for multiple guilds/discord servers so you don't have to manage them on your own.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  constructor(options?: PlayerManagerOptions)
  ```

  For available options see [PlayerManagerOptions](#playermanageroptions).

- **Example**

  ```ts
  import { PlayerManager } from "discord-player-plus";

  const playerManager = new PlayerManager();
  ```

### get()

Gets an existing player for the given guild id or creates one if it does not exist.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  get(guildId: string, optionOverrides?: Partial<PlayerOptions>): Player
  ```

- **Details**
  `optionOverrides` parameter can be used to specify player options for individual guild players. They will be deep merged with options passed to the [PlayerManager](#playermanager).

  For available player options see [PlayerOptions](#playeroptions).

- **Example**

  ```ts
  const player = playerManager.get("my-guild-id");
  ```

### find()

Gets the player for the given guildId if it exists. Does not create a player.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  find(guildId: string): Player | undefined
