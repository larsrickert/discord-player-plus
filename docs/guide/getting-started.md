# Getting Started

This section will help you installing `discord-player-plus` to use it as a discord bot.

::: warning Node.js version
As of `discord.js` v14 you have to install Node 16.9 or higher (see [discord.js documentation](https://discordjs.guide/additional-info/changes-in-v14.html)).
:::

## Step 1: Installation

Install `discord-player-plus` and `discord.js`.

```bash
npm i discord.js discord-player-plus
```

## Step 2: Create discord client

You need to create a discord client for your bot to interact with the discord API.

```ts
import { Client, GatewayIntentBits } from "discord.js";
import { Command } from "discord-player-plus";

// this is the discord client for your music bot
const client = new Client({
  intents: [
    GatewayIntentBits.Guilds,
    GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages,
    GatewayIntentBits.GuildVoiceStates,
  ],
});

// put all slash commands that your bot offers in here
// we will add them in a later step
const slashCommands: Command[] = [];

// register the slash commands when the bot is started
client.on("ready", async (client) => {
  console.log(`Bot ready and logged in as ${client.user.tag}`);
  await client.application.commands.set(slashCommands);
});

// actually login the discord bot
// important: you should not expose your discord client token in your git repository.
// you can e.g. use dotenv (https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) for this and add the .env file
// to your .gitignore
client.login("DISCORD_CLIENT_TOKEN");
```

## Step 3: Create the PlayerManager

The `PlayerManager` should only exist once in your application and is responsible for managing the different music players for multiple guilds/discord servers so you don't have to manage them on your own.

Extend the code from [step 2](#step-2-create-discord-client) by adding the following code above `const slashCommands`:

```ts
import { handleSlashCommand, PlayerManager } from "discord-player-plus";

// you can set player settings that apply to each guild
const playerManager = new PlayerManager({
  playerDefault: {
    initialVolume: 50,
  },
});

// the interactionCreate event is emitted when a user executes a slash command
// here, we want to run our commands
client.on("interactionCreate", async (interaction) => {
  // the handleSlashCommand helper is provided by discord-player-plus and checks if the given slash command
  // is supported and executes it accordingly.
  await handleSlashCommand(
    interaction,
    slashCommands,
    playerManager.translations
  );
});
```

## Step 4: Create commands

Now we want to add slash commands to the `slashCommands` array that we already defined in [Step 2](#step-2-create-discord-client). `discord-player-plus` provides [pre-build slash commands](/guide/commands) for all its core functionality.

However, here is an example for creating a custom command:

```ts
import { Command } from "discord-player-plus";

const myCustomCommand: Command = {
  name: "mycommand",
  description: "Does some cool stuff",
  // the run method is the execution point of the command
  // it is called by the `handleSlashCommand` helper that we defined earlier
  run: async (interaction) => {
    const player = playerManager.find(interaction.guildId);
    if (!player || !player.isPlaying()) {
      await interaction.reply({
        content: "ðŸ¤– I am currently not playing anything.",
        ephemeral: true,
      });
      return false;
    }

    await interaction.reply({
      content: `I am playing the current song since ${Math.round(player.getPlaybackDuration() / 1000)} seconds`
      ephemeral: true,
    });
    return true;
  },
};

slashCommands.push(myCustomCommand);
```

## Usage without commands

`discord-player-plus` can of course be used without commands or pre-build commands. Below is an example for playing tracks.

```ts
import { PlayerManager } from "discord-player-plus";

// create your discord.js client here

const playerManager = new PlayerManager();
const player = playerManager.get("my-guild-id");

// get your voice channel here, e.g. from a slash command
const voiceChannel;

const searchResult = await player.search("Luis Fonsi - Despacito");
if (searchResult?.tracks.length) {
  await player.play({
    channel: voiceChannel,
    // play first matched song for Despacito
    tracks: searchResult.tracks[0],
  });
}
```
