## API changes

### PlayerEngine

The `search` method of type [`PlayerEngine`](/api/core#playerengine) and therefore all [player engines](/guide/engines) has been changed to return [`SearchResult | null`](/api/core#searchresult) instead of `SearchResult[]`.

Previously, the search result was an array but it always contained either exactly one element or none (if no search result was found). Thats the reason why it has been changed.

If you manually use the `search` method of any pre-built player engine or you created your own engines, make sure to update it accordingly.

### Player

As consequence of the above described change to the `PlayerEngine` type, the [`search()`](/api/core#search) method of the Player has also been updated the same way.

If you use the `player.search()` method, make sure to change your code to:

```ts
const searchResults = await player.search("Luis Fonsi - Despacito"); // [!code --]
const searchResult = searchResults[0]; // [!code --]
const searchResult = await player.search("Luis Fonsi - Despacito"); // [!code ++]

if (!searchResult?.tracks.length) {
  console.log("No search results found for Despacito");
} else {
  console.log(
    `Found ${searchResult.tracks.length} matching tracks for Despacito`
  );
}
```
